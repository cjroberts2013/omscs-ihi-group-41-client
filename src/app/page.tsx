          The goal of this project is to create efficiency in work-flow for medical providers with doctor-patient interactions. 
          To accomplish this task, our team developed a web-based application for medical providers to record the interaction in the background. 
          Since the patient information is captured in the background the provider is no longer required to focus on a screen as they are interacting with the patient.
